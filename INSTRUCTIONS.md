## 📋 What You Need to Add

**Required Files (you need to copy these):**

### Step 1: Add Your Files
1. Copy your `Supporter.jpg` to the project folder
2. Copy your `Fredoka-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf` to the project folder

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create new repository
2. Name it: `techtom-background-generator`
3. Make it **Public**
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 3: Deploy with Script
Open Terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Branch: "main", Folder: "/ (root)"
5. Click Save

## 🎯 Your Live URL
After deployment: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/techtom-background-generator`

## 🛠 Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If the script doesn't work, use these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/ioannis.douloumis1/Desktop/techtom-background-generator
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: TechTOM Background Generator"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtom-background-generator.git
